Classification Algorithms Repository
Overview

This repository contains implementations and examples of various classical classification algorithms including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Minimum Distance Classifier

Naive Bayes Classifier

And more...

It provides tools for training, evaluating, and visualizing the performance of these classifiers on datasets, helping users understand and compare different classification techniques.

Features

Implementation of multiple supervised classification algorithms

Data splitting into training and testing sets

Model training and prediction for each classifier

Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of results, including confusion matrices and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

Easy to extend with new classifiers or datasets

Supported Algorithms
Algorithm	Description
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	Classifies based on the closest training examples
Minimum Distance Classifier	Assigns samples to the class with the nearest mean vector
Naive Bayes Classifier	Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
(More can be added)	
Requirements

Python 3.x

scikit-learn

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Install all dependencies with:

pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classification-algorithms.git
cd classification-algorithms


Run classification scripts for different algorithms, for example:

python knn_classifier.py
python naive_bayes_classifier.py
python min_distance_classifier.py


Each script will:

Load a dataset (you can modify or extend datasets)

Train the specified classifier

Evaluate and print performance metrics

Visualize results (e.g., confusion matrix, PCA plots)

How to Add New Classifiers

Create a new script or module for your classifier.

Follow the existing data loading and splitting approach.

Implement the classifier training and prediction.

Add evaluation and visualization code as needed.

Optionally update the README with your classifier.

Example Output
Accuracy: 0.95
Confusion Matrix:
[[50  2]
 [ 3 45]]

Precision: 0.96
Recall: 0.94
F1-Score: 0.95


Visual plots will also be displayed to illustrate classifier performance.
